That easy. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.
 Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself
 to others through painting.

We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Have fun with it. Don't be bashful drop me a line. A fan brush can be your best friend.
