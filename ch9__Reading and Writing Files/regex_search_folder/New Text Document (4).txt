It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. 
I get carried away with this brush cleaning. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. 
We must be quiet, soft and gentle.

I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.
 See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.
