Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to 
express yourself to others through painting. Trees grow however makes them happy.

Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. There are no mistakes.
 You can fix anything that happens. It takes dark in order to show light. Everything is happy if you choose to make
 it that way. You are only limited by your imagination. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and
 doesn't hurt anyone.
