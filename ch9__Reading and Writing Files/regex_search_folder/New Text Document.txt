There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. 
Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. This is a fantastic little painting.

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. A 
tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. See how easy it is to create a little tree 
right in your world. Just make a decision and let it go. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want.
